# Elm Palette colors

This Elm module provides a few color palettes that you can use in your projects.

The color types are derived from the
[avh4/elm-color](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/avh4/elm-color/latest/)
package, which is a commonly used package across the Elm ecosystem for colors.

## How to install

In your terminal, run the following command:

```sh
elm install noordstar/elm-palette
```

The package will then be installed into your project.
